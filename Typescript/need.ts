// Need for ts


// Type script variables type inference


// a is number here

let a = 10

// If i try to change value of a to a string it's gonna give an alert

a = "anoop"

// another way of having types to the variables

let name : string

// Here only name variable will have string data type 

name = "hi"


// To run typescript go the the file location and in terminal type - tsc filename.ts


export{}
